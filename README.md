# Flower Prediction Neural Network
I created a neural network website from scratch, without the help of any machine learning libraries. The website consists of an input panel that can be used to predict if a flower is red or blue depending on the input data.

Here is the dataset:
```
Key: [length, width, colour]
Colour: 0 = Blue, 1 = Red

[2.0   ,1.0   ,0]
[3.0   ,1.0   ,0]
[2.0   ,0.5   ,0]
[1.0   ,1.0   ,0]
[3.0   ,1.5   ,1]
[4.0   ,1.5   ,1]
[3.5   ,0.5   ,1]
[5.5   ,1.0   ,1]
```
