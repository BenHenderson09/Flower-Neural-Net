# Flower Prediction Neural Network
I created a neural network website from scratch, without the help of any machine learning libraries. The website consists of an input panel that can be used to predict if a flower is red or blue depending on the input data. i trained the network on a very small dataset I made,
```
Key: [length, width, colour]
Colour: 0 = Blue, 1 = Red

[2.0   ,1.0   ,0]
[3.0   ,1.0   ,0]
[2.0   ,0.5   ,0]
[1.0   ,1.0   ,0]
[3.0   ,1.5   ,1]
[4.0   ,1.5   ,1]
[3.5   ,0.5   ,1]
[5.5   ,1.0   ,1]
```
## How it's made
This neural network was made with Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries) for portability and it is my first neural network. The most challenging part of this project was learning the required calculus as I just turned 14 this summer(2018), so I have not yet learnt it in school.

## Use
To allow this code to be ran easily from anywhere without any desktop software, I made it in JavaScript with HTML. This code can be ran on a coding website such as JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/benh09/sov89w61/4/ if the link is still working) or just download and click on the NetworkDisplay.html file (layout doesn't scale for small screens).
